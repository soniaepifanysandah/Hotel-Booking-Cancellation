# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Background
  In the global hotel industry in Europe, the cancellation rate is close to 40% (source: https://hospitalitytech.com/global-cancellation-rate-hotel-reservations-reaches-40-average). This trend has had a negative impact on hotel operations, including:
  1. Loss of potential revenue due to an increase in the number of vacant rooms resulting from order cancellations.
  2. If left unchecked, these consumer habits will continue to grow, causing a reduction in revenue and overall profitability for the hospitality industry.
